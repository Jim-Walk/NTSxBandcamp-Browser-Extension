# NTSxBandCamp Browser Extension

Developed with Firefox, untested on Chrome. Intended to load BC links for NTS shows, where possible. Still a little Janky.

Thanks to cure53 for [DOMpurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify). This extension uses version 2.4.0

## TODO

- [x] Use BandCamp icon for link
- [ ] Figure out how to properly require purify
- [ ] Submit Extension
- [ ] Receive Feedback
- [ ] Create option to open search page rather than linking directly
- [ ] Make compatible with Chrome
